# WemCharacterMod
Wem is an ethereal, psychic- inspired (and really just is "Mew" from the pokemon franchise. A character with a rich set of mechanics and abilities
Psychic Energy system, let's get creative while keeping it balanced and engaging.
        Wem's Psychic Mechanics
        Sanity Mechanics:

Wem does not experience insanity.

He does not gain sanity from food and loses sanity during sleep.

Wem starts at 0 sanity.

Psychic Force replenishes FASTER at high sanity levels and is utilized to activate Wem's abilities.

Psychic Energy Acquisition:

At sanity levels above 50, mobs drop a special inventory item called Psychic Energy (visualized as purple souls).

Stack size, spawn/despawn rates, and drop mechanics mirror Wortox's souls.

Psychic Energy can be consumed by Wem to restore his Psychic Force.

Enlightenment State:

Wem enters an Enlightenment state at high sanity levels, 

While in Enlightenment, Wem may be attacked by Gestalts (likely, though undecided).

Basic Attack:

Wem's basic attacks deal 40 damage to mobs.

Each attack drains 0.5 Psychic Force (PF).

This uses Winona's Portasol animation.

Costs 5 PF per teleport.

Hardboiled Crafting:

Wem can craft an item called Hardboiled using a Tallbird Egg and Psychic Force.

Hardboiled is a non-perishable item.

When consumed, it functions like a Jelly Bean or Wormwood’s Compost Wrap, providing gradual healing or similar effects to health.

This ability utilizes Abigail's scare animation.

      Wem's Cons and TM System Proposal
Wem Cons:

Wem is vulnerable to Bug, Ghost, and Dark elements.

Takes an additional +10 damage from:

All bee-related enemies, spider-related enemies, shadow creatures, and ghosts.

This extra damage bypasses armor and cannot be reduced in any way.

This mirrors Walter's allergy to bees mechanic.

    Would like to see implemented but not vital:
    TM System Proposal: and Unnatural Portal Ability
    
Introduce a TM (Technical Machine) system for Wem’s abilities:

Abilities are unlocked via blueprints or crafted TMs.

Recipes for TMs scale with rare drops and require Psychic Energy as a crafting component.

Possible new TMs to implement:

Solar Beam:

Utilizes the Scrappy Werepig’s laser animation.

A powerful, ranged laser attack with a charge-up mechanic.

100 sanity points.
